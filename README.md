## 💡 What Is It?

A report engine built in R + RMarkdown that automatically generates::

- ✅ Tables for demographics and distributions (gt)
- ✅ Listings of raw clinical data
- ✅ Figures for adverse events (ggplot2)
- ✅ Statistical analysis (Fisher’s Exact Test)
- ✅ Data validation before report generation

Fully reproducible, auditable, and compliant with regulatory best practices (ICH E3, CDISC).

## 📦 Technologies

- R (tidyverse, gt, rmarkdown)
- Output formats: Word, HTML, or PDF
- Example dataset in CSV format (semicolon-separated)

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

- **`analysis.Rmd`**: Main notebook that runs all analyses, generates tables, figures, and validations..
- **`R/tlf_functions.R`**: Reusable functions such as create_gt_table().
- **`data/clinical_data.csv`**: Example dataset for demonstration (CSV format, semicolon-separated).
